    <!-- Team: Krisha Hemani & Isaiah Ameho
    Contributions: Krisha worked on the CSS for the html webpage including centering and coloring the tables as well as creating the table using HTML. Isaiah Worked on inserting the table image into the HTML Webpage.-->
    <!--We believe inserting the table as an HTML table is the better way because it allows the programmer to edit values within the table and change the tables color as well as size.-->
